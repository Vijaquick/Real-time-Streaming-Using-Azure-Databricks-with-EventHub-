# Architecture
![Real-Time Streaming Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malvik01/Real-Time-Streaming-with-Azure-Databricks/main/Azure%20Solution%20Architecture.png)
Azure Event Hub (Order Events) 
          â†“
   ðŸŸ¤ Bronze Layer (Raw staging layer in Delta)
          â†“
   ðŸŸ¦ Silver Layer (Cleaned, flattened, structured tables)
          â†“
   ðŸŸ¨ Gold Layer (Aggregated analytics: customer spend, item sales, revenue)


# Features

ðŸŸ¨ Gold Layer:

Customer total spend

Quantity sold per item

Total revenue per item

- Uses event time + watermarking for late event handling

- Data stored in Delta Lake tables for ACID-compliant updates

# Technologies Used
Azure Databricks (Structured Streaming)
